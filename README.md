# Penguins-Species-DBSCAN

Introduction

In this notebook, we will explore the application of the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to the Penguins Species dataset. This dataset contains observations of penguin species, and our goal is to uncover natural groupings within the data without prior knowledge of the species labels.

Why DBSCAN?

DBSCAN is a powerful clustering algorithm known for its ability to:

Identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes.

Handle noise and outliers effectively.

Operate without needing to specify the number of clusters in advance. 

These characteristics make DBSCAN a suitable choice for our penguin species dataset, where we aim to detect natural clusters and potentially noisy data points.

About this file

The dataset consists of 5 columns:

culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)

culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)

flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)

body_mass_g: body mass (g)

sex: penguin sex
